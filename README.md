# My STM32 Projects

This repository contains a collection of experimental projects and learning exercises using STM32 microcontrollers.
It serves as a playground for exploring STM32 features, peripherals, and development techniques.

## STM32 Black Pill

The STM32 Black Pill is a small, complete, and breadboard-friendly board based on STMicroelectronics's STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller, which integrates a high-performance, ARM® Cortex®-M3 32-bit RISC core operating at a 72 MHz frequency, high-speed embedded memories (Flash memory 64Kbytes and SRAM up to 20 Kbytes), and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses. The board offers two 12-bit ADCs, three general purpose 16-bit timers plus one PWM timer, as well as standard and advanced communication interfaces such as I2Cs and SPIs, USARTs, USB and CAN.
